Introduction

Libft is a personal C library created from scratch to understand and replicate several fundamental functions of the C standard library. This project serves as a foundation for all future projects at School 42, providing essential tools for managing strings, memory, linked lists, and more.

Functions Implemented

This library includes implementations of:

Memory manipulation: ft_memset, ft_memcpy, ft_memmove, ft_memcmp, etc.

String manipulation: ft_strlen, ft_strlcpy, ft_strlcat, ft_strncmp, etc.

Character checks and conversions: ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_tolower, ft_toupper, etc.

Linked list functions (bonus part): ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstiter, etc.


Bonus

Additionally, it includes linked list functions to help manage t_list structures.

Project Structure

üìÅ libft/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/              # Contains all function implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ includes/         # Contains the libft.h header file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile          # Script to compile the library
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # This file

Compilation

To compile the library, use the Makefile provided:

make

This command will generate a libft.a static library, which can then be linked to other projects.

To clean up object files, use:

make clean

To remove all compiled files, including the static library, use:

make fclean

Usage

1. Clone this repository.


2. Compile using the Makefile.


3. Link libft.a with your own project:

gcc your_project.c -L. -lft -o your_project


4. Include libft.h in your code to access the functions:

#include "libft.h"



Notes

The t_list struct used in the bonus section has a content field of type void*, allowing it to store data of any type.

This library is limited to the functions and types specified in the project requirements.
